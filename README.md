Lending & Borrowing Platform with Collateral Management
Project Overview
A decentralized smart contract that allows users to deposit collateral in one token and borrow another token against it. The collateral remains locked until the loan is fully repaid, ensuring secure and trustless lending.

Vision
To build a transparent, trustless lending protocol where users can leverage their crypto holdings without relinquishing custody, while maintaining safe collateral ratios and minimizing liquidation risks.

Key Features
Collateral-backed lending with secure token locking

Adjustable collateral ratio set by the contract owner

Collateral unlocks automatically upon full repayment

Liquidation function to handle undercollateralized loans

Admin privileges to withdraw unused tokens

Future Enhancements
Integration with Chainlink oracles for real-time collateral valuation

Implementation of interest rates based on loan duration

Support for multiple tokens for both collateral and loan assets

Development of a user dashboard to monitor loan health and status
