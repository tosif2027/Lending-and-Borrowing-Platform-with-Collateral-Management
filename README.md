# Lending and Borrowing Platform with Collateral Handling
## Project Overview
This is a decentralized smart contract system that lets users borrow one type of cryptocurrency by locking up a different type as collateral. The collateral stays locked until the borrower fully repays the loan.

## Project Goal
To build a secure, trustless system where people can borrow crypto by pledging their own tokensâ€”no need to trust or hand over control to any third party. The system ensures loans are always backed by enough collateral.

## Main Features
- Loans backed by crypto: Users deposit collateral to receive loans.
- Owner-set collateral ratio: The admin can decide how much collateral is required.
- Collateral release on repayment: Once the borrower repays the full amount, their collateral is unlocked.
- Automatic liquidation: If a loan becomes too risky (collateral value drops), the system can liquidate it.
- Admin token access: The admin can withdraw any unused tokens from the contract.

## Future Plans
- Live price updates: Use Chainlink oracles to get real-time token prices for accurate collateral checks.
- Interest system: Add interest to borrowed loans.
- Support multiple tokens: Let users use different tokens for both loans and collateral.
- User-friendly dashboard: Allow users to see loan status and risk level easily.
